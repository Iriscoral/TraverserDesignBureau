TDB_jdgdfy,CUSTOM,"One of the components of the Overwatch programme, this forms part of an interdiction network of small and medium-sized independent unmanned orbital defence platforms that can intercept enemy ships to some extent and make enemy operations on the ground extremely difficult.",,,
TDB_planet1_description,CUSTOM,"The first and last base of the Traverser's Association, the home of the hopes of countless people. After the rebooting of the Mothership and through the efforts of the Traversers, the planet has been built into a habitable and well-defended fortress, protected by a coalition of unmanned and conventional fleets, and home to the core of the Association, the Traverser Design Bureau.",,"In addition to the Star Fortress that guards Intersection, there are countless defence platforms lined up neatly in near-Earth orbit, their flashing beacons and mounted turrets clearly visible as a net that surrounds the entire Intersection.

Below, in the darkness of night, the lights of the city decorate the planet like a starry sky, while farther away a special large platform seems to be casting a bright white glow towards the planet's backlight.",
TDB_station,CUSTOM,"One of the key factors in the settlement of the Traversers' Association, this huge orbital fortress was once a Domain Explorarium mothership, now acts is the lifeblood of the Traveller Association. Most areas of the Mothership have been completely rebuilt or dismantled in numerous systematic constructions, now rendering it as an completely unrecognisable fortress.",,"The vast Star Fortress is both an important base for the Association's space forces and one of the key anchor points for ensuring the security and normalcy of Intersection's trade, with any military and civilian ships attempting to approach being scanned by its vast radar and communications arrays.

Association-owned manned ships patrolling the perimeter, along with unmanned ships, enthusiastically guide incoming and outgoing civilian ships, making the fortress bustling but not chaotic.",
TDB_Survey_ship,CUSTOM,"An exploration mothership from the Domain period, long abandoned and quietly orbiting the Indulge. The hull is in a state of disrepair and bears the message ""Dangerous area, do not approach"" written by the Traverser's Association.",,"Most of the equipment inside the mothership of this long-dormant Domain Mothership has been removed by the Association, leaving only the vacant dock with a large open area. Some of the warning lights and signs are still barely working, particularly on the passive energy harvesters",

TDB,FACTION,"The Traverser's Association is a group of exiles from other worlds who set out to survive, having previously been part of a large mercenary group under the Freedom Alliance. As they grew in power, they settled the system they had stumbled upon and built it into a true fortress by integrating the technologies and exploration of various worlds, creating this association of travellers and like-minded people. A central body, the Traveller Design Bureau, leads the way as an extremely pro-foreigner force that is hospitable but strictly disciplined. As long as you abide by their laws, you will be more than welcome.

What is clear is that the Bureau is now offering special warships and weapons to reputable clients.",,,

TDB_quan_fan_she,SHIP,"It would be hard to find another fighter more powerful than the Total Reflection class in the entire field, with a combination of shields and armour combined with a complex but powerful weapon system that allows this super fighter to destroy frigates and even destroyers with ease. The design office has also added escort drones on both sides of the fuselage to make it equally easy to deal with swarms of fighters.",,,
TDB_mi_san_guang,SHIP,"The Atmospheric/Cosmic dual purpose UAV was developed because the Design Office's Pan-Light Unmanned Interceptor was unable to meet the air control requirements of fleet warfare. The large number of fragmentation missiles and rapid-fire machine guns were highly effective in delivering heavy hits to light targets. However, it is clear that both the air-to-air missiles and the twin-barrelled machine guns only threaten the shields of small and medium-sized ships and are therefore ineffective against heavy warships. Its excellent aerodynamic profile ensures that it can fly at very high speeds even in the atmosphere.",,,
TDB_bian_ge,SHIP,"The Transformation Class mech was an immature attempt to use the technology gathered from other worlds, but it was clearly not a successful attempt, as the humanoid body was too heavily occupied by the huge rotor chain gun system and anti-aircraft missiles, making it impossible to install shield generators. Even with the small space deflectors installed, their slow speed and large size made them easy targets for air superiority fighters. However, the robustness of these mechs and their ability to land in combat were the key factors that attracted the attention of the Design Bureau and were constantly adapted to produce the current Transformer mechs.",,,
TDB_man_fan_she,SHIP,"A super-heavy escort gunship designed by the Traveller Association, the Diffuse Reflection class uses several point defence lasers of various types to provide a lifeline to friendly forces in need of escort, with an additional ion beam mounted to allow it to repel smaller ships. It is worth noting, however, that the Diffuse Reflection sacrifices the shield generator in order to be able to carry this amount of point defence. Resilence isn't a problem, however; the heavy armour mounted on the gunship will ensure its survival.",,,
TDB_pian_zhen_guang1,SHIP,"The bomber was naturally valued by the Design Bureau as an essential element in carrier-based anti-ship operations, and thus the Polarised Light class was designed. Its powerful firepower and reliable shields all point to a bomber that can be trusted.",,,
TDB_fan_guang_yuan,SHIP,"The Floodlight, a mass-produced drone manufactured by the Traveller Design Office, is primarily used for air superiority by the fleet and is equipped with a point defence laser and a barely adequate shield generator to protect its fragile hull. Of course, its low price and large numbers as a mass-produced drone make up for any shortcomings.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
TDB_gugu,SHIP,"Appearing as nothing more than a Kite-Class shuttle in Traversers' Association paint, the sensors detected a missile mount modification similar to that of the Kite-Class, but the area that should have been the viewing dome returned an incomprehensible reading.

A little bit of green and blue floats by in a trance, like the sound of an empty valley, the song is wispy, gentle and slightly husky. As you sing, you seem to hear another song resonating with it. When you try to track down the song, it drifts away into the starry sky with the wind.

Yet you have the feeling that she is looking forward to singing with you.",,,
TDB_hui_feng,SHIP,"It is a ship made entirely of nanobots, a warship and an ark of civilisation.

It is a fully automated ship, but for some reason it has reserved enough space for a single crewmember - and should you ask Greywind about it, she simply stares at you with naught a word about the matter.",,,
TDB_Pansy,SHIP,"This ship incorporates a mysterious and elaborate system powered by an unknown energy source.

Project No. A-1348B39, an experimental ship of the Traverser Design Bureau to verify psychic energy technology, was later renamed "" Pansy "" according to the logbook.
The ship was discovered from a deep, uninhabited space and managed to restore some of its systems to operation before returning to civilisation and resuming operations.

The ship's logbook contains several letters to and from home, as well as an unsent draft.
[Comm log C8-02D1-205709]
""Have a safe day, don't miss it.""
[Status: Undelivered]",,,
TDB_yun_cheng,SHIP,"A superb cargo ship designed by the Traveller Design Bureau. The successor to the Gentle Breeze class, the Cloud City class also has a powerful and sophisticated salvage system and is capable of carrying large amounts of cargo while transporting significant amounts of fuel. If you're ready to explore the universe and don't have a suitable transport ship, she's the one to choose!",,,
TDB_yu_yun,SHIP,"A heavy defensive platform built into the Cumulonimbus-Class aviation fortress, capable of being reassembled through the fortress' nano hangars after destruction, carrying a battery of weapons that provide a degree of close-in firepower for the fortress.",,,
TDB_ji_liu,SHIP,"The massive hull is equipped with a jump system built on a replica of the Reality Perforator, which allows the ship to rip or distort reality to achieve long-range leaps, at the end of which the space around the ship shakes to damage hostile targets and has a chance to repair a small amount of its own structure. Good turret range and manoeuvrability combined with its own drones also allow it to support allies in the vicinity or to make tactical moves at a very fast rate.

One of the products of the Traversers' Association's Overwatch programme is an unmanned battleship with a special AI, which is widely deployed around the Traveller Design Bureau for defensive purposes.",,,
TDB_yu_ren,SHIP,"The Rainblade-Class unmanned frigates have great manoeuvrability and are often seen as front-runners in the Overwatch defence fleet. This of course means that they tend to be among the top ranked ships in the entire fleet in terms of battle damage, but this disadvantage is completely compensated for by the cheapness of their construction. The Rainblade still class inherits the downside of the entire unmanned series - an extremely lacking weapons configuration.

One of the products of the Traversers' Association's Overwatch programme, it is an unmanned warship with a special AI that is widely deployed for defence around the Traverser Design Bureau, but for a number of reasons this design is not suitable for solo cruises.",,,
TDB_xi_yu,SHIP,"The Drizzle-class unmanned frigate is one of the few unmanned ships in the Overwatch Network that has a large number of weapons, and provides a bare minimum of air defence and escort for small to medium sized unmanned fleets with its panoptic light sources.

One of the products of the Traversers' Association's Overwatch programme, it is an unmanned warship with a special AI that is widely deployed for defence around the Traverser Design Bureau, but for a number of reasons this design is not suitable for solo cruises.",,,
TDB_chuan_yun,SHIP,"The Cloud Piercer class Unmanned Early Warning Ship (EWS) is one of the cores of the Overwatch programme, providing friendly forces with a wide field of view and electronic countermeasures support through the large early warning radar it carries. But naturally, its most noteworthy feature is its ability to disable the phasing coils of enemy phased ships.

One of the products of the Traversers' Association's Overwatch programme, it is an unmanned warship with a special AI that is widely deployed for defence around the Traverser Design Bureau, but for a number of reasons this design is not suitable for solo cruises.",,,
TDB_feng_ya,SHIP,"The Windstorm-Class of unmanned destroyers relies on their own weapons enhancement systems to form the backbone of the Overwatch network. Though it also inherits the disadvantages of the entire design lineup - that being extremely undergunned.

One of the products of the Traversers' Association's Overwatch programme, it is an unmanned warship with a special AI that is widely deployed around the Traverser Design Bureau for defensive purposes.",,,
TDB_tai_yang_yu,SHIP,"A completely overhauled ship, the Sunshower is equipped with a huge weapon system that can easily carry all types of missiles, a built-in Fox Turnip Vertical Launch Array and a unique tactical system that allows her to easily suppress small to medium sized enemy fleets. To enable her to cope with the complexities of the battlefield, the Design Bureau has also given her the ability to respond to enemy forces in close proximity, with built-in drones and an ample array of secondary weapons to enable her to deal with approaching forces.

One of the products of the Traversers' Association's Overwatch programme, it is an unmanned warship with a special AI that is widely deployed around the Traverser Design Bureau for defensive purposes.",,,
TDB_gu_yu,SHIP,"The first blueprints for the Valley Rain-Class existed from the time the Design Bureau was formally established, and the weakness of the Association's military forces at the time led to the Valley Rain-Class being designed not as a specialist missile cruiser, but as a more versatile design. As a result, her predecessor was often used as the flagship of a small fleet. But with the development of the Association's military power and the creation of the Traverser Design Bureau it was clear that this design was no longer relevant. That heavy versatility focus often meant a loss of any specialist competency. Thus the creation of the modern Valley Rain-Class guided missile cruiser - she was redesigned by the Design Bureau, with enhanced missile capabilities and the development of the Bureau's Intercloud Vertical Launch Array. However, even with the specialisation, you can still see hints of her predecessor in her body.",,,
TDB_chuan_yue_xue_zhe,SHIP,"The special strategic importance of phasing technology as a ""submarine"", as it was on Old Earth and other worlds, successfully attracted the attention of the Design Bureau. This led to the design of the Traverser Scholar class as an experimental subspace phase cruiser, whose extreme manoeuvrability combined with the lethal weapons built into its hull made it an unpredictable hunter in the field. As a result, the ship isoften sent out on decapitation missions by the Design Office is a single ship.",,,
TDB_qiong_ding,SHIP,"The Dome was originally designed to act as a support defence for the fleet, and in order to adapt to the complex and changing conditions of battle the Dome did not opt for extreme methods such as fitting a large number of point defences to strengthen its defences, but instead chose to become a versatile force, using the combination of aircraft and shipboard firepower to achieve its objectives. This, however, resulted in the Dome being less proficient in all aspects and struggling more against larger ships. However, the Dome's reliability is greatly enhanced by its unique Sky Dome defence system, as it is able to deploy its nanofactories to provide friendly forces with the opportunity to change the situation when it is most needed.",,,
TDB_ren_zhao_guang,SHIP,"It is a warship that has been dusty for years, and everything inside the ship has been tidied up neatly.

You make your way to the command room and find a letter on the captain's seat in the command room, and by the handwriting you are pretty sure it is still written by the same young girl. The letter gives you an account of the ship's experiences.

As her name suggests, she was once the embodiment of the ambitions of a broken empire, but as the empire declined and broke down she radiated a faint light in a different form.

This light did not fade with the fall of the empire, her will has been carried on by future generations, and her mission has been fulfilled.

-- ""Now I give her to you, that you may use her to write your own brilliance.""",,,
TDB_shuang_hen,SHIP,"The Frostbite-Class Battlecruiser is a capital ship with considerable manoeuvrability. The Space Shift system inside her, one of the Design Bureau's favoured developments, gives her great damage reduction and speed during activation, allowing her to be relatively flexible in the face of complex battlefield conditions. The Frostbite is also a good sub-capital hunter and killer, which is why it is widely deployed by the Association in various fleets.",,,
TDB_yu_lian,SHIP,"The Rain Curtain-Class Destroyer is the backbone of the Traversers' Association fleet, with its excellent gun design, high energy focus system and excellent and reliable shields making it capable of taking on even larger ships. The ship's reliability and handling have earned her a very good reputation throughout the Persean Sector, and as a direct result the Rain Curtain is the most popular ship sold in the Association.",,,
TDB_feng_xian,SHIP,"The Windstring-class is often used as the vanguard of the fleet to clear the way or to get ahead of the fleet, which can lead to heavy losses in large-scale fleet battles. Well, it is obvious that this is a common problem with most conventional frigates. In order to reduce casualties and increase the reliability of the ship the frigate is equipped with flash and a powerful shield generator, which gives the Windstring greater survivability.",,,
TDB_he_feng,SHIP,"The Gentle Breeze-Class is a cargo ship designed for explorers, capable of carrying a considerable amount of cargo and a certain amount of fuel. And with its built-in salvage hull, the Wakefield will shine in your salvage expedition.",,,
TDB_hengfeng,SHIP,"As the mainstay of the Traveller Association, the Constant Wind-Class is able to attack enemy fleets from a sufficient distance thanks to its six Fracture Veritcal Launch Arrays and advanced targeting system. This is reinforced by the thermal circulation system built into the hull. No sensible captain would take the output capabilities of the Constant Wind lightly.",,,
TDB_ji_yu_yun,SHIP,"The Cumulonimbus-class Aviation Fortress is one of the Association's largest warships. In combat, this behemoth has nine decks that can carry an extremely large fleet of aircraft. As her name implies, she will bring a rain of aerial firepower to the enemy and will be absolutely overwhelming in the face of cloudy conditions.

As one of the most powerful, expensive and advanced assets of the Association, she will be deployed as the flagship of only the strongest main fleets, for which she is equipped with a full range of advanced battlefield command systems. Of course, as an mobile fortress, although mostly of the type that sits in the rear, she is also fully capable of entering the front line of battle alongside friendly forces thanks to her reliable shields and the multi-layered defence provided by the unmanned knights guarding her - the Resonance Defence Drones and the Rain Cloud class defence platforms. In normal times, she can also fend off small and medium-sized ships that try to sneak up on her back.",,,
TDB_ji_yu_yun_you,SHIP,What are you looking at? Don't you know I'm only a module?,,,
TDB_ji_yu_yun_zuo,SHIP,What are you looking at? Don't you know I'm only a module?,,,
TDB_xing_yun,SHIP,"One aspect of the Constant Wind-Class battleship was a break-away missile vertical launch unit that was of immense use in fleet operations, but due to the difficulty of building the Constant Wind class its numbers were not sufficient to meet the needs of the Association. The design bureau therefore designed a relatively inexpensive arsenal of ships specifically designed to carry missiles. With its powerful array of missile firepower, the Gyokumo became a popular support ship in the Persean Sector, as the feel of the missiles firing in unison was a great source of security.",,,
TDB_ceng_ji_yun,SHIP,"The Stratocumulus-Class is the Design Bureau's most frequently used medium carrier, with an ample missile array and a special space-time acceleration system giving her the ability to provide substantial fire support to the front line alongside air strikes. She is designed to match the Heron class within the Sector, and as such, she is as fast as the Heron and deserves to be called a high-speed carrier.

According to official sources, the Stratocumulus-Class did receive help from an allied faction [Blue Sea Fisheries] in its construction, but according to gossip, it was actually converted to a symmetrical shape due to OCD on the designers' part.",,,
