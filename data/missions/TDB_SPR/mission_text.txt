Location: Hyperspace, just beyond the Indulge system jump point
  As the time for the operation draws nearer, your fleet has been ordered to prioritise the Indulge jump point once the operation has begun to take care of the heretical galactic defence fleet there, clearing the way for the main fleet to follow.

  Looking out of the window, the light from the track lights and the ship's engines illuminate the darkness of hyperspace, and so far so good.

  For some reason, it is clear that we have a definite advantage in this raid, but there is something vaguely unpleasant in your mind. You rub your brow to stop yourself from thinking about it.

  "May the great Ludd bless us,"You murmured in your mind.

  The entire fleet is already at the highest level of combat readiness. The priest who accompanies the ship at the rear is giving a pre-war speech.

  - "These fae from other realms are uniting with the abominable ai to pollute our world. Now our great Lord is calling us to turn them into ashes! We will descend upon them as the sword of the Lord. The Great Lord will bless us, and may the armour of divine blessing be solid as gold! For the great Ludd!"
